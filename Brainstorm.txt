Q1: What is your project about?
I want to build a guide that helps people decide what parts they want for their keyboard and build it.

Q2: Who is your audience?
I want to present it to people who are interested in keyboards but may not yet have the skills/knowledge to build one.
While this is not intended to be a guide for people who know nothing at all about computers 

Q3: What is your purpose?
I want to build a guide that helps newcomers become a part of the community and learn about basic computer science/computer engineering skills.

Q4: What do you see yourself doing?
I think it will be kind of a wiki type website with a bunch of separated articles about specific topics.
